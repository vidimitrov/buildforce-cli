# Buildforce CLI - Project Specification

## Goals

The Buildforce CLI aims to provide a command-line interface for accessing and utilizing Buildforce's planning capabilities, making it easier for developers to interact with the platform through their terminal.

## Components

1. **CLI Interface**

   - Command-line parsing and execution
   - User input handling
   - Output formatting
   - Interactive prompts for configuration options

2. **AI/LLM Integration**

   - LangChain integration for AI capabilities
   - OpenRouter API integration
   - Context-aware system prompts
   - Template processing
   - AI tools rule file management (Cursor, Cline, Windsurf)
   - Session-based chat history tracking
   - Project memory integration
   - Autonomous planning agent with file operation capabilities

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment variable handling with validation
   - Flexible model configuration with overrides
   - User settings management
   - Template management
   - AI tools rule file setup and configuration
   - Session state management

### Autonomous Planning Agent

The autonomous planning agent is a key component that enables independent session management:

1. **Agent Capabilities**:

   - Autonomous decision making using LangGraph
   - File operation tools for reading, writing, and searching
   - Context-aware system prompts with project memory
   - Structured response handling to prevent recursion

2. **File Operations**:

   - Reading file contents with error handling
   - Writing content to files with validation
   - Searching for files matching patterns
   - Maintaining clean code structure

3. **User Experience**:
   - Seamless integration with planning command
   - Clear error messages and recovery
   - Autonomous session file management
   - Consistent behavior across operations

The agent is designed to reduce manual effort in session management while ensuring high-quality output.

### Automatic Onboarding System

The automatic onboarding system is a key component that streamlines project initialization and documentation generation. It provides:

1. **Project Analysis**:

   - Automated scanning of project structure
   - Intelligent analysis of dependencies and configurations
   - Smart prioritization of documentation files

2. **Documentation Generation**:

   - Automatic creation of architecture.md and specification.md
   - Dynamic content generation using Eta templates
   - Support for manual review and refinement

3. **User Experience**:
   - Clear progress indicators
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Configurable analysis options

The system is designed to reduce manual effort in project setup while ensuring high-quality documentation output.

## LLM-Based Documentation Generation

The system provides automatic documentation generation during project initialization using LLM technology. Key features include:

1. Core Functionality:

   - Automatic analysis of project structure
   - Generation of architecture and specification docs
   - Integration with existing templates
   - Quality validation and formatting

2. User Experience:

   - Progress reporting during generation
   - Clear error messages and recovery
   - Configurable through environment variables
   - Extensible for future improvements

3. Quality Assurance:
   - Basic validation of generated content
   - Error handling and retries
   - Logging for debugging
   - Future plans for advanced analysis
