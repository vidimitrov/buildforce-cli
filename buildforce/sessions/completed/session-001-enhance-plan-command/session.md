# Session: Enhance Plan Command with Initialization Check

## Objective

Improve the user experience of the `buildforce plan` command by adding a check for the existence of the `buildforce` folder and prompting the user to initialize the project if it doesn't exist.

## Tasks

- [x] Task 001: Add initialization check to plan command

## Implementation Details

The implementation will:

1. Create utility functions to check if the `buildforce` folder exists
2. Implement a prompt for initialization if the folder doesn't exist
3. Allow the user to specify a project name or use the default (current directory name)
4. Continue with the planning session after successful initialization
5. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback

## Expected Outcome

The enhanced `plan` command will:

- Check for the existence of the `buildforce` folder before starting a planning session
- Offer to initialize the project if the folder doesn't exist
- Use a user-friendly prompt to get the project name with a sensible default
- Seamlessly continue with planning after initialization
- Provide clear feedback throughout the process

## Recap

This session successfully enhanced the `buildforce plan` command with initialization checks. The implementation includes:

1. A utility function `isBuildforceInitialized()` that checks if the `buildforce` folder exists in a specified directory.

2. A user-friendly prompt function `promptForInitialization()` that:

   - Asks the user if they want to initialize the project
   - Allows them to specify a project name or use the default (current directory name)
   - Initializes the project using the existing template system
   - Provides clear feedback throughout the process

3. An enhanced `plan` command that:

   - Checks for initialization before starting a planning session
   - Prompts for initialization if needed
   - Continues with planning after successful initialization
   - Exits gracefully if the user chooses not to initialize

4. Comprehensive tests to verify the functionality in both initialized and uninitialized environments.

The implementation follows best practices for error handling and user experience, ensuring that the command is robust and user-friendly. All tasks and subtasks have been completed and tested.
