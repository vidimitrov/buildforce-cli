# Session 2: AI Tools Integration

## Objective

Enhance the initialization process to ask users which AI-assisted coding tools they use (Cline, Cursor, Windsurf) and copy the appropriate rule files to the repository root based on their selection.

## Decisions

TLDR: Implement a checkbox prompt for AI tool selection and handle rule file copying with proper edge case handling.

- Use inquirer for checkbox-style prompts
- Copy Cursor rules directly to .cursor/rules/
- Append to existing Cline/Windsurf rule files if they exist
- Handle all edge cases for file/directory existence

## Tasks

- [x] 1. AI Tools Prompt Integration

## Expected Outcome

- Enhanced initialization process that sets up AI tool rule files based on user selection
- Proper handling of existing files to avoid overwriting user content
- Clear feedback to users about the setup process

## Verification / Testing Steps

1. Initialize with no existing rule files:

   - Verify correct files are created for each selected tool
   - Verify correct content in each file

2. Initialize with existing rule files:

   - Verify Cursor rules are copied correctly
   - Verify Cline/Windsurf rules are appended correctly
   - Verify no data loss in existing files

3. Initialize with various tool combinations:
   - Verify only selected tools have rules set up
   - Verify proper error handling

## Recap

The AI Tools Integration session has been successfully completed. This session focused on enhancing the initialization process to support various AI-assisted coding tools by copying appropriate rule files during initialization.

### Key Accomplishments

1. Added interactive AI tools selection during project initialization

   - Implemented checkbox-style prompts using inquirer
   - Set all options checked by default for better UX
   - Provided clear feedback to users about the setup process

2. Implemented rule file handling for different AI tools

   - Cursor: Copying buildforce.mdc to .cursor/rules/
   - Cline: Copying or appending to .clinerules
   - Windsurf: Copying or appending to .windsurfrules

3. Added robust error handling and edge cases
   - Checking for already initialized projects
   - Respecting existing files by appending content rather than overwriting
   - Providing clear error messages for all operations

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Handling existing rule files without overwriting user content
   **Solution**: Implemented a check for existing files and append content instead of overwriting

2. **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent behavior across different AI tools
   **Solution**: Created separate helper functions for each tool with standardized error handling

3. **Challenge**: Providing clear feedback to users
   **Solution**: Added descriptive console messages for each operation and clear error messages

### Key Decisions

- Used inquirer for checkbox-style prompts for better user experience
- Decided to append to existing Cline/Windsurf rule files rather than overwriting
- Implemented a check for already initialized projects to prevent duplicate initialization
