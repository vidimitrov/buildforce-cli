# Session: Implement Automatic Onboarding

## Objective

Implement automatic project documentation generation during the `buildforce init` command by extracting information from the repository and creating accurate architecture.md and specification.md files.

## Overview

This session focuses on implementing the automatic onboarding process that will be triggered when a user runs `buildforce init`. The goal is to automatically analyze the project and generate accurate documentation without requiring manual intervention.

## Key Decisions

1. **Analysis Approach**: Chunked Analysis

   - Break down project analysis into manageable chunks
   - Prioritize chunks based on relevance and dependencies
   - Process chunks in order until sufficient information is gathered
   - Keep architecture modular for future tree-sitter integration

2. **Shared Tools**: Minimal Set

   - ✓ Implement essential file operations (read, search, write)
   - ✓ Create project utilities for common operations
   - ✓ Keep tools simple but extensible
   - ✓ Make tools available to both planning agent and init command

3. **Documentation Generation**:
   - Focus on documentation and configuration files first
   - Extract information for both architecture.md and specification.md
   - Allow for manual review and refinement
   - Maintain clear stopping criteria for analysis

## Tasks

- [x] Task 001: Implement Shared Tools
- [x] Task 002: Implement Chunked Analysis System
- [x] Task 003: Implement Init Agent and Command Integration

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** (Task 001) ✓

   - ✓ Implement shared file tools module
   - ✓ Create core file operations (read, search, write)
   - ✓ Add project utilities (directory listing, file patterns)
   - ✓ Set up testing infrastructure for file operations
   - ✓ This phase provides the foundation for both analysis and agent

2. **Phase 2: Analysis System** (Task 002)

   - Create analysis module structure
   - Implement chunk management system
   - Add analysis core with chunk prioritization
   - Integrate with shared file tools
   - Add comprehensive testing for analysis
   - This phase builds on the file tools to provide analysis capabilities

3. **Phase 3: Agent and Integration** (Task 003)

   - Create init agent structure and interfaces
   - Implement agent core using analysis system
   - Add documentation generation using file tools
   - Integrate with init command
   - Add user feedback and progress reporting
   - Implement error handling and recovery
   - Test full workflow end-to-end
   - This phase brings everything together in the init command

Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring that dependencies are properly managed and tested. The implementation follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the foundational file tools, then building the analysis system, and finally creating the agent that ties everything together.

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**

   - Successfully analyzes project structure
   - Generates accurate documentation
   - Handles large codebases efficiently
   - Provides clear error messages
   - Offers intuitive user feedback

2. **Quality**

   - ✓ Comprehensive test coverage
   - ✓ Clean, modular code
   - ✓ Clear error handling
   - ✓ Good logging
   - ✓ Well-structured agent architecture

3. **Usability**
   - Clear progress indicators
   - Intuitive error messages
   - Easy to review and refine
   - Fast execution
   - Configurable options

## Dependencies

- ✓ Node.js fs promises API
- ✓ glob for pattern matching
- Graph data structure for chunk dependencies
- LangChain for LLM integration
- Command-line argument parser

## Notes

- ✓ Keep implementation modular for future enhancements
- ✓ Focus on essential functionality first
- ✓ Ensure good error handling and logging
- ✓ Maintain clear documentation
- ✓ Consider adding dry-run mode for testing
