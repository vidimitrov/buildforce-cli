# Session: Make Planning Agent Autonomous

## Objective

Convert the planning agent into a true autonomous AI agent by adding file operation tools and proper context, using the existing LangGraph structure. This will allow the agent to autonomously create and manage session files without hardcoded workflows.

## Overview

The planning agent already has a good foundation with:

- LangGraph-based structure for autonomous decision making
- System prompt with rules, architecture, and specification
- Example tool implementation showing the pattern to follow
- Basic workflow with agent and tools nodes

We need to enhance it with:

1. File operation tools (read/write/search) following the same pattern as the example tool
2. Active session context in the system prompt
3. Proper tool binding to the agent

## Key Decisions

1. **File Tools Implementation**:

   - Follow the same pattern as `exampleTool` in `tools.ts`
   - Use Zod for schema validation
   - Keep tools simple and focused
   - Include proper error handling
   - Return structured responses to prevent recursion issues

2. **System Prompt Enhancement**:

   - Add active session context
   - Include tool capabilities
   - Maintain existing context (rules, architecture, specification)
   - Add clear examples of tool usage

3. **Tool Binding**:
   - Use the existing LangGraph tool binding mechanism
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Keep the workflow simple
   - Return structured responses for better agent understanding

## Tasks

- [x] Task 001: Implement File Tools
- [x] Task 002: Update System Prompt
- [x] Task 003: Bind Tools to Agent

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: File Tools** (Task 001)

   - Create readFile tool
   - Create writeFile tool
   - Create searchFiles tool
   - Add proper error handling

2. **Phase 2: System Prompt** (Task 002)

   - Add active session context
   - Document available tools
   - Maintain existing context

3. **Phase 3: Tool Binding** (Task 003)
   - Update tool initialization
   - Bind tools to model
   - Test tool usage

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**

   - Agent can read files
   - Agent can write files
   - Agent can search files
   - Agent has proper context

2. **Quality**

   - Clean tool implementations
   - Proper error handling
   - Well-documented tools
   - Comprehensive tests

3. **Usability**
   - Clear tool documentation
   - Intuitive error messages
   - Easy to extend
   - Consistent behavior

## Dependencies

- LangGraph framework
- Existing planning agent structure
- File operation utilities
- Test infrastructure

## Notes

- Keep tools minimal and focused
- Maintain good error handling
- Consider future extensibility
- Document all changes
