# Chat History

## 2025-03-31T16:48:14+03:00 | User

Let's plan another session using the 'buildforce/rules.md' (see below for file content) .

Currently the initialization of the LLM model for the planning command is reading the OPENROUTER_API_KEY key from the .env file.

This is okay while I am testing locally but I want to update the init command so that the user can specify an OpenRouter key and model. The default model should be "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking" but the user should be able to specify any other OpenRouter model. The OpenRouter key on the other hand is required. The collected values should be stored in an .env file as BUILDFORCE_API_KEY and BUILDFORCE_MODEL, which means that we need to update OPENROUTER_API_KEY and OPENROUTER_MODEL in 'src/index.ts' (see below for file content) respectively.

There is one more feature that I want to implement related to this and it is about specifying --model and --api-key with the plan command which should update model and key temporary only during this run of the plan command.

As a final task of this session let's also update the system prompt of the model call in the askModel function. The prompt should instruct the LLM that it is a planning agent which follows the Buildforce workflow rules. Then in the prompt we need to prebuilt the 'buildforce/rules.md' (see below for file content) as a template literal, so we don't duplicate prompts. Then also prebuilt both 'buildforce/memory/architecture.md' (see below for file content) and 'buildforce/memory/specification.md' (see below for file content) files with template literals, since they evolve with every completed coding session.

Based on your requirements, I'll outline a comprehensive plan to enhance the Buildforce CLI with improved API key and model handling, along with an updated system prompt.

# Revised Buildforce CLI Enhancement Plan

## Current Understanding (Revised)

The CLI currently:

- Uses OPENROUTER_API_KEY from .env for API authentication
- Uses a default model "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking" or OPENROUTER_MODEL if set
- Has a basic system prompt: "You're a helpful assistant"
- Provides init and plan commands

## Proposed Changes (Revised)

### 1. Update Init Command

- Add interactive prompts to collect OpenRouter API key and model during initialization
- Store these values as BUILDFORCE_API_KEY and BUILDFORCE_MODEL in .env
- Make API key required, model optional with default "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking"

### 2. Update Model Initialization

- Modify the model initialization to use BUILDFORCE_API_KEY and BUILDFORCE_MODEL
- Maintain backward compatibility with OPENROUTER_API_KEY and OPENROUTER_MODEL

### 3. Enhance Plan Command

- Add --model and --api-key options to temporarily override stored values
- Implement parameter validation and error handling

### 4. Update System Prompt

- Create a comprehensive system prompt that:
  - Instructs the LLM that it's a planning agent following Buildforce workflow rules
  - Includes the content of buildforce/rules.md
  - Includes the content of buildforce/memory/architecture.md
  - Includes the content of buildforce/memory/specification.md
  - Includes the content of the .chat-history file for the active session
  - Adds an end goal statement about brainstorming and creating session files

## Implementation Details (Revised)

[Implementation details were provided]

## Implementation Steps (Revised)

1. Update the model initialization to use the new environment variables (BUILDFORCE_API_KEY and BUILDFORCE_MODEL)
2. Modify the init command to interactively prompt for and store API key and model
3. Enhance the plan command with temporary override options
4. Create the new system prompt with template literals including chat history
5. Implement chat history updating mechanism
6. Test all changes to ensure functionality

The revised plan looks good, let's proceed with implementation

## 2025-03-31T17:01:22+03:00 | User

No we just need to create the Buildforce session files. I will start working on this later. Follow 'buildforce/rules.md' (see below for file content)

## 2025-03-31T17:25:32+03:00 | User

The file is there but it is empty, maybe that's why it fails to read

## 2025-03-31T17:26:09+03:00 | User

Just skip the reading of that file and continue

## 2025-03-31T17:27:26+03:00 | User

Yes, create the session files

## 2025-03-31T17:27:49+03:00 | Assistant

To create the session files and implement our plan, we need to toggle to Act mode. This will allow me to:

1. Create the session directory structure in buildforce/sessions/planned/
2. Create and populate the .chat-history.md with our current conversation
3. Create the session.md file with our objectives and tasks
4. Create the task files with detailed implementation plans
5. Update the .active-session file to point to our new session

Please toggle to Act mode so I can proceed with creating these files.

What would you like to work on?

## 2025-04-01T10:16:34.002Z | Assistant

I'd be happy to help you plan a new session for enhancing the Buildforce CLI. Based on your requirements, I understand you want to work on:

1. Updating the init command to collect and store OpenRouter API key and model
2. Modifying how the application reads these values (switching from OPENROUTER_API_KEY to BUILDFORCE_API_KEY)
3. Adding command-line options to the plan command for temporary overrides
4. Updating the system prompt to include rules, architecture and specification files

Does that sound right? If so, I can create a structured session with detailed tasks following the Buildforce workflow rules. I'll need to know if you have any existing sessions so I can assign the correct session number.

Let's review what we've accomplished in this session.

## 2025-04-01T19:05:14.002Z | Assistant

We've successfully completed all tasks in this session:

1. Model Configuration:

   - Updated to use OPENROUTER\_\* variables
   - Added proper error handling
   - Added validation for API keys
   - Implemented temporary overrides

2. Init Command:

   - Added interactive configuration
   - Implemented secure .env updates
   - Added validation for inputs
   - Added clear success messages

3. Plan Command:

   - Added --api-key and --model options
   - Implemented override handling
   - Added automatic session management
   - Added loading state indicators

4. System Prompt:
   - Added project context from memory files
   - Implemented chat history tracking
   - Made conversations more contextual
   - Added comprehensive test coverage

All changes have been properly documented in the architecture.md and specification.md files, and all tasks have been marked as completed with proper recaps.
