# Session 003: Enhance Model Configuration

## Objective

Enhance the Buildforce CLI with improved OpenRouter API configuration and system prompts to provide better flexibility in model selection and configuration, while also improving the planning agent's context awareness.

## Decisions

TLDR: Implement flexible model configuration and enhance system prompts with project context

- Store OpenRouter configuration in BUILDFORCE_API_KEY and BUILDFORCE_MODEL
- Add interactive configuration during initialization
- Allow temporary model overrides in plan command
- Enhance system prompt with project context and rules

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Update model initialization to use new environment variables
- [x] 2. Add interactive OpenRouter configuration to init command
- [x] 3. Add temporary override options to plan command
- [x] 4. Improve system prompt with rules and context

## Recap

The session successfully enhanced the Buildforce CLI's model configuration and system prompts:

1. Model Configuration:

   - Simplified to use only OPENROUTER\_\* variables for better maintainability
   - Added proper error handling and validation
   - Added support for temporary overrides via command options

2. Interactive Configuration:

   - Added smart configuration prompting that checks for existing settings
   - Added validation for required inputs
   - Improved initialization flow with clear success messages

3. Plan Command Improvements:

   - Added --api-key and --model options for temporary overrides
   - Implemented automatic session management
   - Added loading messages for better UX
   - Added comprehensive test coverage

4. System Prompt Enhancements:
   - Added project context from memory files
   - Implemented proper chat history handling
   - Made conversations more natural and contextual

### Key Decisions:

- Simplified environment variables to use only OPENROUTER\_\* for clarity
- Added automatic session management in plan command
- Improved chat history handling to maintain context
- Added comprehensive test coverage for new features

### Challenges & Solutions:

- Challenge: Maintaining backward compatibility while simplifying variables
  Solution: Removed BUILDFORCE*\* variables in favor of OPENROUTER*\* only

- Challenge: Managing chat history effectively
  Solution: Implemented per-session chat history with proper context

- Challenge: Testing complex interactions
  Solution: Created comprehensive test suite with temporary directory management

## Expected Outcome

- OpenRouter API key and model can be configured during initialization
- Configuration stored as BUILDFORCE_API_KEY and BUILDFORCE_MODEL in .env
- Plan command supports temporary model/key overrides via --model and --api-key options
- System prompt includes Buildforce rules and project context
- Chat history properly maintained and included in system context

## Verification / Testing Steps

1. Model Initialization:

   - Verify BUILDFORCE_API_KEY and BUILDFORCE_MODEL are used correctly
   - Confirm backward compatibility with OPENROUTER\_\* variables
   - Test error handling for missing API key

2. Init Command:

   - Test interactive prompts for API key and model
   - Verify .env file is updated correctly
   - Check default model is set when not specified

3. Plan Command:

   - Test temporary override with --model option
   - Test temporary override with --api-key option
   - Verify original configuration remains unchanged after override

4. System Prompt:
   - Verify rules.md content is included
   - Verify architecture.md content is included
   - Verify specification.md content is included
   - Check chat history is properly maintained
   - Test agent's adherence to Buildforce workflow rules
