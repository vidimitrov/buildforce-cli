# Session: Code Refactoring

## Objective

Improve code readability and maintainability by breaking up the monolithic src/index.ts file into modular components with clear separation of concerns.

## Tasks

- [x] Define folder structure and approach for modularization
- [ ] Create folder structure (ai/, utils/, commands/)
- [ ] Extract AI/LangChain logic into dedicated module
- [ ] Extract utility functions into utils module
- [ ] Organize command definitions in commands module
- [ ] Refactor main index.ts as an integration point
- [ ] Verify functionality through testing

## Implementation Details

1. **Folder Structure**:

   - src/
     - index.ts (simplified entry point)
     - ai/ (LangChain integration)
     - utils/ (helper functions)
     - commands/ (commander command definitions)

2. **Module Responsibilities**:

   - **ai/**: All LangChain/OpenAI specific code, prompts, and AI interactions
   - **utils/**: Generic helper functions, file operations, validation
   - **commands/**: Individual command implementations (init.ts, plan.ts, etc.)
   - **index.ts**: Bootstrap code, imports from other modules, minimal logic

3. **Refactoring Approach**:
   - Create new folders without modifying original code first
   - Extract related functionality in logical units
   - Update imports and exports as needed
   - Validate functionality after each major extraction
   - Maintain a clean commit history for easy rollback if needed

## Expected Outcome

- Improved code organization with clear separation of concerns
- Better maintainability for future development
- More focused files with single responsibilities
- Easier testing and extension of functionality
- No changes to existing behavior or functionality

## Key Decisions

- Organize by functionality (AI, utils, commands) rather than by features
- Preserve existing API and behavior throughout the refactoring
- Create index files in each module to simplify imports
- Focus on structure first, leaving optimization for future sessions

## Challenges and Solutions

To be filled in during and after session completion.

## Recap

To be completed after session.
