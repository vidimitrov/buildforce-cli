# Session: Implement Automatic Onboarding

## Objective

Implement automatic project documentation generation during the `buildforce init` command by extracting information from the repository and creating accurate architecture.md and specification.md files.

## Overview

This session focuses on implementing the automatic onboarding process that will be triggered when a user runs `buildforce init`. The goal is to automatically analyze the project and generate accurate documentation without requiring manual intervention.

## Key Decisions

1. **Analysis Approach**: Chunked Analysis

   - Break down project analysis into manageable chunks
   - Prioritize chunks based on relevance and dependencies
   - Process chunks in order until sufficient information is gathered
   - Keep architecture modular for future tree-sitter integration

2. **Shared Tools**: Minimal Set

   - ✓ Implement essential file operations (read, search, write)
   - ✓ Create project utilities for common operations
   - ✓ Keep tools simple but extensible
   - ✓ Make tools available to both planning agent and init command

3. **Documentation Generation**:
   - Focus on documentation and configuration files first
   - Extract information for both architecture.md and specification.md
   - Allow for manual review and refinement
   - Maintain clear stopping criteria for analysis

## Tasks

1. [x] [Task 001: Implement Shared Tools](./tasks/task-001-implement-shared-tools.md)

   - ✓ Create file tools module
   - ✓ Implement core file operations
   - ✓ Add project utilities
   - ✓ Set up testing infrastructure

2. [ ] [Task 002: Implement Chunked Analysis System](./tasks/task-002-implement-chunked-analysis.md)

   - Create analysis module structure
   - Implement chunk management
   - Add analysis core functionality
   - Integrate with file tools

3. [ ] [Task 003: Implement Init Agent and Command Integration](./tasks/task-003-implement-init-agent.md)
   - Create init agent structure
   - Implement agent core functionality
   - Integrate with init command
   - Add user feedback and error handling

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** (Task 001) ✓

   - ✓ Implement shared file tools module
   - ✓ Create core file operations (read, search, write)
   - ✓ Add project utilities (directory listing, file patterns)
   - ✓ Set up testing infrastructure for file operations
   - ✓ This phase provides the foundation for both analysis and agent

2. **Phase 2: Analysis System** (Task 002)

   - Create analysis module structure
   - Implement chunk management system
   - Add analysis core with chunk prioritization
   - Integrate with shared file tools
   - Add comprehensive testing for analysis
   - This phase builds on the file tools to provide analysis capabilities

3. **Phase 3: Agent and Integration** (Task 003)

   - Create init agent structure and interfaces
   - Implement agent core using analysis system
   - Add documentation generation using file tools
   - Integrate with init command
   - Add user feedback and progress reporting
   - Implement error handling and recovery
   - Test full workflow end-to-end
   - This phase brings everything together in the init command

Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring that dependencies are properly managed and tested. The implementation follows a bottom-up approach, starting with the foundational file tools, then building the analysis system, and finally creating the agent that ties everything together.

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**

   - Successfully analyzes project structure
   - Generates accurate documentation
   - Handles large codebases efficiently
   - Provides clear error messages
   - Offers intuitive user feedback

2. **Quality**

   - ✓ Comprehensive test coverage
   - ✓ Clean, modular code
   - ✓ Clear error handling
   - ✓ Good logging
   - ✓ Well-structured agent architecture

3. **Usability**
   - Clear progress indicators
   - Intuitive error messages
   - Easy to review and refine
   - Fast execution
   - Configurable options

## Dependencies

- ✓ Node.js fs promises API
- ✓ glob for pattern matching
- Graph data structure for chunk dependencies
- LangChain for LLM integration
- Command-line argument parser

## Notes

- ✓ Keep implementation modular for future enhancements
- ✓ Focus on essential functionality first
- ✓ Ensure good error handling and logging
- ✓ Maintain clear documentation
- ✓ Consider adding dry-run mode for testing

## Progress

### Task 001: Implement Shared Tools ✓

Successfully implemented the shared file tools module with:

1. Core file operations (read, write, search)
2. Project utilities (root detection, directory listing, pattern matching)
3. Comprehensive error handling
4. Full test coverage
5. Clean and modular implementation

The implementation follows best practices and provides a solid foundation for both the planning agent and init command to work with files efficiently and reliably.
