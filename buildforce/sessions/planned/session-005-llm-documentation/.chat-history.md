I am just analyzing how the most important implementation slipped through so many task definition files, session definition files, etc. This was really the most important part of @session-004-automatic-onboarding and even though I asked you 1 billion times if we are still missing something, we still missed the core of the feature... I am mindblowed.

Anyway, let's of course do this but create a proper session for it and the tasks that we are going to follow by following the @rules.md I don't to repeat the same mistake

You're absolutely right - this is a significant oversight. The core feature of intelligent documentation generation was completely missed despite having detailed plans and discussions. Let's create a proper session following the rules to implement this correctly.

I've created a new session (005) with four main tasks:

1. **LLM Integration Setup**: Setting up LangChain and the LLM service
2. **Chunked Analysis System**: Implementing the planned analysis system
3. **Documentation Generation**: Creating LLM-based content generation
4. **Testing and Validation**: Ensuring quality and correctness

Would you like me to create the detailed task files for each of these tasks? We should follow the task template and ensure we capture all the implementation details, dependencies, and testing requirements.
